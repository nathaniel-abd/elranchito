Website Client: El Ranchito
School: Chester County High School
Group Members: Nathaniel Anderson, Myles Carnell, and Vernon Tucker

Each member had a job just for them tailored for their skills; Nathaniel (Me) did most of the coding that required HTML, CSS, or JS. 
Vernon Tucker did the main design, ensuring that the website would have fonts and images that would properly portray what the website is about. 
Finally, Myles Carnell was in charge of data collection, going to our client and getting necessary information, such as staff names, what their jobs were, and pictures of the inside to use for the site.
